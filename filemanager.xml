FCKeditor is distributed under the LGPL Open Source license.

Important Note: The advanced setting "UserFilesPath" is a folder under the global upload folder (under PHP -> General Options -> File Upload tab, see PHP Settings in the help file), e.g. if the global upload folder is "uploads/" (relative to application root) and "UserFilesPath" is "userfiles/", then the user file folder is "uploads/userfiles/" (relative to application root). If "UserFilesPath" not specified, the global upload folder will be used. Make sure you have setup write permssions for the upload folder properly. 

Note: FCKeditor is not part of PHPMaker. Please read "Third-Party Tools" in the help file.
